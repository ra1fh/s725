This software is a derivative of s710 software provided here:

http://code.google.com/p/s710/

At the moment it is being developed on OpenBSD and hence Linux/Mac OS
X/FreeBSD support might have suffered a bit.

This software provides Unix users with the ability to communicate
with the Polar S710 heart rate monitor via the serial IR interface,
native IR, and the USB interface.

If you wish to enable USB support, you need to have the libusb library
(http://libusb.sf.net) installed, with version of at least 0.1.8.
libusb supports Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS X.

Stefan Kleditzsch (kleditzsch <at> iwr <dot> uni-heidelberg <dot> de)
decoded the CRC algorithm and has also figured out how to get native
IR communication working, for users who have that capability.

The main utility, s710get, takes a -d argument which specifies the
driver type to be used to communicate with the device.  Valid values
are "serial", "ir", and "usb".  A device filename is required for -d
values of "serial" and "ir", but not for "usb".  If no -d option is
given, it is the same as -d serial.  Examples:

s710get -d serial /dev/ttyS0
s710get -d ir /dev/ttyS0
s710get -d usb
s710get /dev/ttyS0 (same as -d serial)

YOU MUST HAVE WRITE PERMISSION TO THE DEVICE to use s710get.  The
easiest way to do this is to run the program as root.

Downloaded workout files are stored in the current directory by
default. To change this, you can pass the -f command line option to
s710get:

s710get -d usb -f ~/workout/

Robert Estes (estes <at> transmeta <dot> com) supplied a number of corrections
to errors I had made in decoding parts of the file format.  He also decoded
the lap speed and temperature values.

Max Matveev (makc <at> sgi <dot> com) decoded a good deal more of the file 
format, including average and max speed, OwnCal quantities, where the user ID
and exercise name are stored, and more.

Matti Tahvonen (matti <at> tahvonen <dot> com) introduced support for interval
mode in the S625X, the S710, and the S720i.  This had been on the todo list
for a long time.
